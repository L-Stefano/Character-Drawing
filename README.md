# Character-Drawing

The final result is shown in the "TIM截图20180928232917.png"

Some Tips:
1. Don't apply images with high resolution(max of height and width within 200px is recommended.)
2. Don't apply images with images of little difference in color(eg. a picture of the whole scene too dark)
3. Keepping the mapping threshold between 10-60 is better(not necessary).

Thanks very much for the png read library provided by lvandeve.
The project address is https://github.com/lvandeve/lodepng
(It's a very simple library without any other lib as "libpng" or "zlib". I highly recommend it to those who wanna read/write PNG files.)
